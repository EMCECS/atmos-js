# Atmos JavaScript connector

JavaScript API wrapper to provide simple access to EMC Atmos Cloud Storage

# AtmosJSUploader

Currently, Atmos does not support cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). Therefore, atmos-js does not support cross-domain requests (unless running in node.js). That means that your application needs to be served from the same domain as your Atmos storage. Generally, the easiest way to do this is to serve your application itself directly from Atmos. To assist with this, the AtmosJSUploader application (Available on the Downloads page) can be used to upload your HTML application. Please see The [[AtmosJSUploader]] page.

# Browser Support

Please check the [[BrowserSupport]] wiki page for a list of supported environments.

HTML5 App

A really cool HTML5 Browser App written using the JavaScript API.  See the [[HTML5 App]] wiki page for details.
